[ ] copy swe's ephemeris database during build (download from github?)
[ ] require using SEFLG_SWIEPH (currently we use SEFLG_MOSEPH which doesn't require data files)
[ ] replace thread max-execution-time tricks with limiting the max number of loops and throwing (in debug builds only?)
[ ] fix date/tz for webassembly build
[ ] encapsulate tzdata (so we can run bare executable, wihout any tzdata files at all)
[ ] encapsulate swe's ephemeris database (so we can run with higher precision while having no data files at hand)
[ ] check all tests for 2019-March-1,2
[ ] atirikta ekadashi
[ ] atirikta dvadashi
[ ] test cases from past Narasimha's calendars (all?)

== When compiling with gcc from msys2/mingw32, the .exe depends on
- libwinpthread-1.dll
- libstdc++-6.dll
- libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
About 2MB total (counting only .dll-s).

How to run tests in node/webassembly:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ emcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-s ASSERTIONS=1 -s DEMANGLE_SUPPORT=1 -D HAS_THREADS=0 -s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0" ..
$ cmake --build .
$ node test-main.js

  MVP:
        command line utility:
                given base time point, calculate next ekadashi:
                        input:
                                - base time point (UTC)
                                - coordinates
                        output
                                - date(s) of fasting
                                - type
                                        shuddha
                                        mishra
                                        atirikta Ekadashi
                                        atirikta Dvadashi
                                        suddha Dvadashi (?)
                                - paran time interval

done:
[+] ensure that sweph repo actually corresponds to 2.07.01 (bar Perl archives)
[+] tag sweph repo as v2.07.01 (or otherwise accordingly)
[+] reimplement Swe_Time as std::chrono's timepoint type based on double days
[+] move everything to vp namespace (for VaishnavaM Panchangam) [2020-01-08]
[+] rename Swe_Time to juldays_ut or something [2020-01-08]
[+] cleanup JulDays_UT constructors to get rid of type-dangerous int year etc (use std::chrono-related types). [2020-01-09]
[+] rename Swe_Zoned_Time to something like JulDays_Zoned, fix constructors [2020-01-09]
[+] add ApproximateJulDays_UT for approximate comparisons (in test-calc.cpp), fix Expected_Vrata comparison [2020-01-09]
[+] fix vrata tests to accept time within 5 seconds range to pass (otherwise we get half-second differences after upgrading to sweph 2.08, breaking some tests)
    "Ekadashi 2019-02-28"/riga
    "Ekadashi 2019-03-17"/frederikton
    "get_next_tithi_start"
[+] upgrade sweph to 2.08, tag it [2020-01-09]
[+] expect ./tzdata dir to be in the current directory, copy tzdata dir during build (add_custom_command, -E copy_directory, $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:MyExe>) [2020-01-09]
