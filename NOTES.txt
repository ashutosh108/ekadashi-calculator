[ ] make sure we get reasonable error message when eph folder not found (add overall exception handler? add test?)
[ ] when eph files not found and the SWE_SWIEPH was supposed to be used: use SWE_MOSEPH but print large warning
[ ] make sure we get reasonable error message when tzdata folder is missing (add test?)
[ ] then tzdata folder not found: still run but print all times as UTC
[ ] allow running with SWE_MOSEPH as an option (do not require eph files)
[ ] fix date/tz for linux and webassembly build (fix tz's cmake)
[ ] encapsulate tzdata (so we can run bare executable, wihout any tzdata files at all)
[ ] encapsulate swe's ephemeris database (so we can run with higher precision while having no data files at hand)
[ ] check all tests for 2019-March-1,2
[ ] atirikta ekadashi
[ ] atirikta dvadashi
[ ] test cases from past Narasimha's calendars (all?)
[ ] fix the case when the date given is dvadashi but actual vrata day was yesterday. E.g. 2020-01-20 kiev gives proper 2020-01-20 as vrata date, but 2020-01-21 kiev gives wrong 2020-01-21 as vrata date.

== When compiling with gcc from msys2/mingw32, the .exe depends on
- libwinpthread-1.dll
- libstdc++-6.dll
- libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
About 2MB total (counting only .dll-s).

How to run tests in node/webassembly:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ emcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-s ASSERTIONS=1 -s DEMANGLE_SUPPORT=1 -D HAS_THREADS=0 -s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0" ..
$ cmake --build .
$ node test-main.js

  MVP:
        command line utility:
                given base time point, calculate next ekadashi:
                        input:
                                - base time point (UTC)
                                - coordinates
                        output
                                - date(s) of fasting
                                - type
                                        shuddha
                                        mishra
                                        atirikta Ekadashi
                                        atirikta Dvadashi
                                        suddha Dvadashi (?)
                                - paran time interval

done:
[+] ensure that sweph repo actually corresponds to 2.07.01 (bar Perl archives)
[+] tag sweph repo as v2.07.01 (or otherwise accordingly)
[+] reimplement Swe_Time as std::chrono's timepoint type based on double days
[+] move everything to vp namespace (for VaishnavaM Panchangam) [2020-01-08]
[+] rename Swe_Time to juldays_ut or something [2020-01-08]
[+] cleanup JulDays_UT constructors to get rid of type-dangerous int year etc (use std::chrono-related types). [2020-01-09]
[+] rename Swe_Zoned_Time to something like JulDays_Zoned, fix constructors [2020-01-09]
[+] add ApproximateJulDays_UT for approximate comparisons (in test-calc.cpp), fix Expected_Vrata comparison [2020-01-09]
[+] fix vrata tests to accept time within 5 seconds range to pass (otherwise we get half-second differences after upgrading to sweph 2.08, breaking some tests)
    "Ekadashi 2019-02-28"/riga
    "Ekadashi 2019-03-17"/frederikton
    "get_next_tithi_start"
[+] upgrade sweph to 2.08, tag it [2020-01-09]
[+] expect ./tzdata dir to be in the current directory, copy tzdata dir during build (add_custom_command, -E copy_directory, $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:MyExe>) [2020-01-09]
[+] copy swe's ephemeris database during build (file(DOWNLOAD ...) from github) [2020-01-10]
[+] require using SEFLG_SWIEPH (currently we use SEFLG_MOSEPH which doesn't require data files) [2020-01-10]
[+] check downloaded ephemeris files' hash each time ("if exists" tricked me: I've somehow got zero-length semo_18.se1 and got crash inside sweph) [2020-01-10]
[+] add test for calc::get_next_tithi_start(): ensure that get_tithi actulaly returns value close enough to target tithi. [2020-01-10]
[+] Calc::get_next_tithi_start(): limit max number of loops and return empty optional if looping. Remove thread max-execution-time tricks in testing. [2020-01-10]
[+] create basic travis-ci integration (windows builds) [2020-01-13]
[+] make main executable statically linked by default [2020-01-13]
[+] replace date::date's cmake files with our own (suggested official way did not work and old naive "include_subdirectory" way caused problems by installing unneeded files) [2020-01-14]
[+] setup install in cmake: copy .exe, tzdata/ and eph/ [2020-01-14]
